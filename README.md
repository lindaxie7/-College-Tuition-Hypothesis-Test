# -College-Tuition-Hypothesis-Test

## Overview of Project

To conducting a Hypothesis-Test on Public and Private College Tuitions.
The null hypothesis, H0, states that the means of both private and public tuition will be equal. The alternative hypothesis, Ha, states that the mean cost of private college tuition will be greater than the mean cost of public college tuition.

### Data
Gathered our data by using publicly available information online that reports the tuition cost of virtually every college in the United States. This data was made available by the US Government on collegescorecard.ed.gov. We then needed to narrow down the available data to take a sample. We used an online random number generator to pick 30 college.

### Results

Using t.test command with alternative=“two.sided” option, I obtained the 98% confidence interval of mean difference of (-24317.94, -13917.60). Hence at the 98% confidence level, I can conclude that the mean cost of attendance of public colleges is less than cost of attendance of private colleges.
